Why Use It on Kaggle?

- Expose FastAPI/Flask API to the Internet
  Kaggle notebooks run in a cloud environment, but by default, they are only accessible internally (no public ports).
  Using ngrok with your auth token creates a public URL like:
  https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app
  → Anyone can call your API through this link.

- Persistent and Stable Tunnels
  Without an auth token, ngrok only provides temporary tunnels that may disconnect.
  With an auth token, the connection is more stable and lasts longer.

- Quick Demo / Sharing
  Perfect for sharing your FastAPI/Flask backend directly from Kaggle without deploying to AWS/GCP/Azure.

⚡ Basically, ngrok.set_auth_token on Kaggle lets you publicly expose your API just like it’s deployed on a real server.
